This is a basic TicTacToe game that runs in the console.  The class includes a second player that always makes the correct move 
and can't be beaten.  This is not a true AI, because the game logic is simple enough that any two competent players will always 
play to a draw without altering strategy - each move is either one of the first two moves, a losing move, or a 
non-losing move.
